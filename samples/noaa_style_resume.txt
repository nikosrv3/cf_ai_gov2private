PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
• Climate scientist and physical oceanographer with 11 years of experience in coastal modeling, remote sensing of oceanographic processes, and development of operational forecast products for coastal resilience.
• Expertise in coupled atmosphere-ocean modeling, sensor network deployment, and the translation of model outputs into decision-support tools for emergency managers and coastal planners.
• Experienced in managing large, interdisciplinary teams and multimillion-dollar observational programs.

EDUCATION
2014 Ph.D., Physical Oceanography, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego
2010 M.S., Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University
2008 B.A., Environmental Science & Economics, Williams College

FEDERAL & RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
2020–Present
Program Manager / Senior Scientist, Marine Climate Services Division, NOAA Coastal Observations and Forecasting Center
• Lead the Coastal Rapid Response Observing Network (CRRON) — a program coordinating coastal sensor arrays, autonomous surface vehicles, and citizen-science tide gauges across the Northeast Shelf to produce improved short-term surge and inundation forecasts.
• Oversee program budget ($5.4M/year) and lead partner coordination with state agencies, academic institutions, and port authorities.
• Developed and operationalized the "NowCast Coastal Surge" product used by three regional Warning Coordination Meteorologists to inform evacuation thresholds.

2016–2020
Research Scientist, Coastal Processes Lab, Northeastern University (funded by NOAA grants)
• Led field campaigns for nearshore current profiling and sediment transport during storm seasons; published methodological advances for HF radar assimilation into coastal models.
• Contributed to regional sea-level rise vulnerability assessments used by municipal planners.

2014–2016
Postdoctoral Researcher, Ocean Modeling Group, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
• Developed data-assimilation schemes integrating glider and HF radar observations into mesoscale coastal models; improved short-term forecast skill during extreme events.

SELECTED GRANTS & PROGRAMS
• PI — NOAA Coastal Observing Integration Grant, $3.2M (2021–2025): Coastal Rapid Response Observing Network (CRRON).
• Co-PI — NSF/NOAA Collaborative Project: "Assimilating Citizen Tide Data into Operational Forecasts", $2.1M (2018–2022).
